# StarControl

A fan remake of the classic Sega Genesis *Star Control* game. This project focuses on two primary modes of play: navigating a rotating 3D starfield and engaging in physics-based ship-to-ship combat.

## Strategic Starfield

The strategic layer presents a rotating 3D starfield that simulates depth with parallax. In this mode you will:

- Manage fuel and crew across long-distance travel.
- Explore star systems, discovering planets and meeting alien races.
- Position your fleet to defend territory and launch offensives.
- Select 10â€“12 ships for your fleet and decide which participate in each encounter.
- Encounter random events and pursue strategic objectives as you roam the stars.

## Battle / Melee Mode

When fleets meet, the game switches to a top-down combat arena featuring:

- Physics-based movement with inertia and momentum.
- Unique ships from each race with distinctive weapons and abilities.
- A central planet whose gravity well enables slingshot maneuvers.
- Limited battery power for weapons and finite crew serving as ship health.
- Wrap-around screen edges for a continuous battlefield.

Mastering each ship's handling, weapon range, and special abilities is crucial for success.
